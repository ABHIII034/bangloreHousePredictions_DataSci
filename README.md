# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction — Data Science Project

This is a **Data Science project** that predicts house prices in Bangalore using a trained machine learning model.  
It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and a simple web interface to interact with the model.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts house prices based on features such as:

- **Total area (square feet)**
- **Number of BHKs**
- **Number of bathrooms**
- **Location**

The model was trained using real housing data, and the application provides **quick price estimation** based on user inputs.

## 📈 Data Science Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Collected Bangalore house price data from publicly available datasets.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   Used Pandas & NumPy to clean missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Selected important features such as `total_sqft`, `bhk`, `bath`, and `location`.

4. **Model Deployment**  
   Integrated model with a Flask backend and HTML frontend for user interaction.
